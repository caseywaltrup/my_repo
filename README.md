Simple C/C++ program to carry out matrix scalar multiplication, addition, transposition, and multiplication
matrix.cpp: C++ implementation of matrix operation software
  Compile with: g++ matrix.cpp -o matrixcpp
  Run with: ./matrixcpp
matrix.c: C implementation of matrix operation software
  Compile with: g++ matrix.cpp -o matrixc
  Run with: ./matrixc
The program was tested by hardcoding the A, B, and C matrices, and coding the required operations, then verifying that the result matched the calculations I did by hand
