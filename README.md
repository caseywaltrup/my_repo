Simple C/C++ program to carry out matrix scalar multiplication, addition, transposition, and multiplication
matrix.cpp: C++ implementation of matrix operation software
  Compile with: g++ matrixcpp.cpp -o matrixcpp
  Run with: ./matrixcpp
matrix.c: C implementation of matrix operation software
  Compile with: g++ matrixc.c -o matrixc
  Run with: ./matrixc
For both files:
  When prompted to enter rows and cols, enter 2 numbers separated by a space. Ex:
    2 3
  When prompted to enter elements, enter a single number. Ex:
    5
These programs were tested by inputting the A, B, and C matrices as given by the instructions, then verifying that the result matched the calculations I did by hand
